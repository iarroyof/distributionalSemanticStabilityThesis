#
# From the first line starting with '#', all onwards is ignored. No lines different from configuration ones (even blank
# ones) at top are allowed. The amount of lines at top is five exclusively (see below for allowed contents).
#
# The first line may be specifying the train data file in sparse market matrix format.
#
# The second line may be specifying the test data file in sparse market matrix format.
#
# The third line may be specifying the train labels file (in learning mode). A real number by line must be associated as
# label of a vector in training data. This line must be replaced by test labels file and followed by model_file and mode
# (options for the MKL object) in pattern_recognition mode.
#
# The fourth line may be specifying the test labels file (in learning mode). A real number by line must be associated as
# label of a vector in test data. This line must be replaced by the model_file followed by mode in pattern_recognition
# mode.
#
# The fifth line indicates options for the MKL object (mode):
#   first character : Problem type : valid_options = {r: regression, b: binary, m: multiclass}
#   second character: Machine mode : valid_options = {l: learning_mode, p: pattern_recognition_mode}
#
# Any other characters and amount of they will be ignored or caught as errors.
#
# For all configuration lines no other kind of content is allowed.
#
# Training data (and its labels) is optional. Whenever no five configuration lines are detected in this file, en error
# exception will be raised otherwise.
